The files in this folder are modified from the GNURadio Guided Tutorial found at 

http://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/gnuradio/wiki/Guided_Tutorials

The tutorial runs through the use of GNU Radio, gnuradio-companion, and basic modulation techniques. The tutorial ends with a QPSK modulator / demodulator that works locally with the gnuradio channel model (modified version of this is in QPSK_Test). I've also separated the tranmit and receive components to work across an actual channel between two USRPs (QPSK_Tx and QPSK_Rx).
