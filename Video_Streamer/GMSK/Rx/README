In order to run the receiver and play to mplayer, you should make a fifo in the local directory (mkfifo rxfifo.ogg), then use the receive_video.sh bash script. Note that the receiver should be run first, then the transmitter.

If edits are made through GRC, build the python script first (in GRC) and then execute with receive_video.sh
